Successes so far
------- 

- Working application which integrates gesture and speech recognition, for now it recognizes only a few simple gestures and voice commands, but extension shouldn't be a problem
   
Problems so far
-------

- Coding and testing - very difficult without the equipment...
- Point clouds - only one example for Kinect SDK, a few more for OpenKinect, OpenCV for Python, stuff like that
- WPF vs Windows Forms - 2 most important examples use 2 different frameworks, integration is challenging
- Many dead ends
